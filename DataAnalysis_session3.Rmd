## Brief story of ggplot2

- This package is an implementation of Leland Wilkinson's **Grammar of Graphics** (here comes the gg prefix)
- Created by Hadley Wickham in 2005
- There are many packages in order to extend the basic ggplot2:
  - GGally
  - gganimate
  - ggpubr
  - ggthemes
  - etc.
  
## The structure of ggplot

- To create a plot with gg, you always need the **ggplot()** function, which has 'data' and 'mapping' argument, and you need a **geom**.
  - **data**: dataset to use for plot (here we use the mpg data.frame)
  - **mapping**: list of aesthetic mappings to use for plot, always in an **aes()** function (like what variables should be on the x axis and what on the y axis)
  - **geom_**: type of plot

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ , y = hwy))+
  geom_point()
```

Alternativly the **data** & **mapping** can be specified inside the geom part. It is useful, when you have multiple dataset or geom on one figure.

```{r}
ggplot() + geom_point(data = mpg, 
    mapping = aes(x = displ , y = hwy))
```

Change the color to red (color = "red") & increase the size (size = 2)

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ , y = hwy))+
  geom_point(color = "red", size = 2)
```


Color everything corresponding to the manufacturer. In this case we need to add the color arguement inside the aes(), because we use a variable from the dataset.
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ , y = hwy,
                                 color = manufacturer)) +
  geom_point(size = 2)
```

Things you can specify 

1. color
2. fill
3. shape
4. alpha (transparency)

#### Shape and fill

If you want to add a fill and a color argument to a point chart, then you need to change the shape to one, which has both (Any which has a blue inner part). 

```{r echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/rproject/adatelemzes/figures/points-symbols.png")
```


```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ , y = hwy,
                                 fill = manufacturer))+
  geom_point(size = 2, shape = 21, color = "black")
```

#### Change the transparency

It is useful if you have many points and they cover each other.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ , y = hwy,
                                 fill = manufacturer))+
  geom_point(size = 6, shape = 21, color = "black", alpha = 0.7)
```

### Import dataset from the OECD webpage

I downloaded a csv file from the OECD webpage. If you open your downloaded files in your browser, then you can see the source url. I copy and paste it in to the read_csv function.

```{r}
fertility <- read_csv("https://stats.oecd.org/sdmx-json/data/DP_LIVE/.FERTILITY.../OECD?contentType=csv&detail=code&separator=comma&csv-lang=en")
```

```{r}
head(fertility)
```

We need only the #1, #6 & #7 column, since the others contain information, which we dont need rigth now.

```{r}
fertility<-fertility[,c(1,6,7)]
```

Lets create a figure, but lets add some labs to that.

```{r}
ggplot(data = fertility, mapping = aes(x = TIME, y = Value, color = LOCATION)) +
  geom_line() + labs(
    x = "Year", y = "Fertility", color = "Countries", title = "Fertility rates",
    subtitle = "1960 - 2017", tag = "Figure 1",
    caption = "total fertility rate in a specific year is defined as the total number of children \n that would be born to each woman if she were to live to the end of her child-bearing years"
  )
```

### Ggplot themes

With the theme you can change the style of your figures. Here are some exapmles:
```{r}
ggplot(data = fertility, mapping = aes(x = TIME, y = Value, color = LOCATION)) +
  geom_line() + theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = fertility, mapping = aes(x = TIME, y = Value, color = LOCATION)) +
  geom_line() + theme_grey()
```

In other packages you may find a lot more. (And yes, you have to use install.packages again to download the package before you use it for the first time)
```{r}
library(ggdark)

ggplot(data = fertility, mapping = aes(x = TIME, y = Value, color = LOCATION)) +
  geom_line() + dark_theme_grey()
```

If you read the  The economist newpaper, then you probably will like the following

```{r}
library(ggthemes)

ggplot(data = fertility, mapping = aes(x = TIME, y = Value, color = LOCATION)) +
  geom_line() + theme_economist()
```

If you want to avoid writing "+ theme_" all the time, you can set a theme as defaul with the set_theme() function.
```{r eval = F}
set_theme(theme_light()) 
```

[I use dark theme in my RStudio, so for example I always start coding with set_theme(dark_theme_grey()) to not hurt my eyes]

Lets use the filter function to modify the fertility data.frame. With the following it will contain observation only from Hungary (HUN).

```{r}
fertility_hun <- filter(fertility, LOCATION == "HUN")
```

If you want to have more contries in your data.frame, then use the %in% sign. It means: LOCATION variable is HUN or AUS or AUT.

```{r}
fertility_hun_aus_aut <- filter(fertility, LOCATION %in% c("HUN", "AUS", "AUT"))
```

With the facet_wrap you can present the time-series on different panel.

```{r}
ggplot(data = fertility_hun_aus_aut, mapping = aes(x = TIME, y = Value)) + 
  geom_line(color = "black") +
  facet_wrap(~LOCATION)
```

If the fertility rate is below 2.1, then the population of the country is decreasing. Lets add this 2.1 line to our figure (It is a horizontal line, so we use geom_hline & geom_vline would be if you want a vertical line). And wiht the linetype argument, you can change the linetype.

```{r}
ggplot(data = fertility_hun, mapping = aes(x = TIME, y = Value)) +
  geom_line(color = "black") + geom_hline(yintercept = 2.1, linetype = "dashed")
```

With the geom_smooth, you can add a trend line. If you set method = "lm", then you get a regression line.

```{r}
ggplot(data = fertility_hun, mapping = aes(x = TIME, y = Value)) +
  geom_line(color = "black") + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

I downloaded some more datasets form the OECD webpage, and merged the datas into one dataset.
```{r eval = T}
populationsize <- read_csv("https://stats.oecd.org/sdmx-json/data/DP_LIVE/.POP.TOT.MLN_PER.A/OECD?contentType=csv&detail=code&separator=comma&csv-lang=en&startPeriod=1960&endPeriod=2018")
lifeexp <- read.csv("https://stats.oecd.org/sdmx-json/data/DP_LIVE/.LIFEEXP.TOT.YR.A/OECD?contentType=csv&detail=code&separator=comma&csv-lang=en&startPeriod=1960&endPeriod=2019")
populationsize <-populationsize[,c(1,6,7)]
lifeexp <- lifeexp[,c(1,6,7)]
names(fertility)[3] <- "fertility"
names(populationsize)[3] <- "pop"
names(lifeexp)[3] <- "lifeexp"
names(lifeexp)[1] <- "LOCATION"

df <- fertility
df <- merge(df, populationsize)
df <- merge(df,lifeexp)
head(df)
```

Now it we have a panel data (= data from different countries for several years  & 3 variables), lets create a small animation with the gganimate package. It can run only in the RStudio and you can save there is you right click on the viewer pane and select save image.

```{r eval = F}
# install.packages("gganimate")
library(gganimate)

ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = lifeexp, y = fertility,
                                group = LOCATION, size=pop)) + 
  geom_point(color = "black", shape = 21, fill = "blue") + 
  gganimate::transition_time(TIME) + 
  labs(title = "year: {frame_time}") +
```
